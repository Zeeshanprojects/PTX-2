                Quality Assurance and Quality Control
              </h2>

              <p className="card-text  service mt-2">
                Quality assurance and quality control may seem the same thing,
                but theyâ€™re not. Apparel garments, accessories, and other
                textile products are assessed for quality in the preproduction
                phase, during production, and with a final inspection after the
                product has been completed. Quality Assurance (QA) is focused on
                the process. It builds quality into each step of the
                manufacturing process including designing, production, and
                beyond.

                In-line Production Inspection
              </h2>

              <p className="card-text  service mt-2">
                In-line product inspection or DUPRO (During Production
                Inspection) is an effective way for customers to know about the
                status of the manufacturing of an order, gain important
                information about the shipment schedule and identify defects
                early on before they affect the entire production.

              <p className="card-text service mt-2">
                We never compromise with the quality as we consider it as our
                success pillar. We believe that compromising on quality leads to
                losing market share or clients. We believe that if we have
                customers, we have everything. That is why, we have appointed a
                separate team to answer the queries of customers and satisfy
                them on their needs. For us customer satisfaction is above all.
